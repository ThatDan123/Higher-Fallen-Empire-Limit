This mod increases the maximum amount of fallen empires on your maps to 13.


Vanilla-----------------Mod

Huge     5-------> 13
Large     4------->8
Medium 3--------> 8
Small     2-------->4
Tiny       1-------->2


Overrides the setup_scenarios folder completely. Not compatible with mods that do the same.

Known bug: Using random amounts of fallen empires limits the number to vanilla values.

Needs to be in [b]use with mods that add more fallen empires[/b] as there are only 5 vanilla fallen empires.

For more varied fallen empires, try looking at my other mod:  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1812858232]Extra Fallen Empires[/url]. That adds 8 more fallen empires.

For Bigger Galaxies, 1250 and 1500 stars, try looking at my other mod: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1831885384] Higher Fallen Empire Limit Bigger Galaxies[/url]
